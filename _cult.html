					<p><b>Uzbeks likely take their name from a khan. A leader of the Golden Horde in the fourteenth century was named Uzbek, though he did not rule over the people who would share his name.

					Modern Uzbeks hail not only from the Turkic-Mongol nomads who first claimed the name, but also from other Turkic and Persian peoples living inside the country's borders. The Soviets, in an effort to divide the Turkic people into more easily governable subdivisions, labeled Turks, Tajiks, Sarts, Qipchaqs, Khojas, and others as Uzbek, doubling the size of the ethnicity to four million in 1924.

					Today the government is strengthening the Uzbek group identity, to prevent the splintering seen in other multiethnic states. Some people have assimilated with seemingly little concern. Many Tajiks consider themselves Uzbek, though they retain the Tajik language; this may be because they have long shared an urban lifestyle, which was more of a bond than ethnic labels. Others have been more resistant to Uzbekization. Many Qipchaqs eschew intermarriage, live a nomadic lifestyle, and identify more closely with the Kyrgyz who live across the border from them. The Khojas also avoid intermarriage, and despite speaking several languages, have retained a sense of unity.

					The Karakalpaks, who live in the desert south of the Aral Sea, have a separate language and tradition more akin to Kazakh than Uzbek. Under the Soviet Union, theirs was a separate republic, and it remains autonomous.

					<p><b>As a secular state with a Muslim majority, where different faiths live side-by-side, engaging one another in peace, tranquility, and respect, Uzbekistan prides itself on its centuries-long traditions of tolerance and inter-religious harmony.

					Many have identified the country’s ethnic diversity and religious harmony as a legacy of the Silk Road, which served as a melting pot of civilizations and cultures.

					Throughout the centuries, the territory of today’s Uzbekistan has been a home for well-known scholars and theologians like the 9th century Imam Bukhari and Imam Maturidi, and the 14th century Baha Uddin al-Naqshbandi who were critical to defining the humanistic essence of Islam, which calls for kindness, peace, and tolerance.

					Uzbekistan is also a land with ancient roots of Christianity, as the Nestorian Church brought the faith to Central Asia from northern Iraq.

					Saint Daniel’s purported fifth century gravesite in Samarkand – which has long been a pilgrimage site for common worship among Muslims, Christians, and Jews – best symbolizes the spirit of religious accord in Uzbekistan.

					Today, our country is confidently presenting an Uzbek model of a secular state in which the moderate and enlightened practices and teachings of  Islam and many other religions and faiths are able to flourish. Uzbek’s society of tolerance includes more than 140 nationalities, as well as 16 religious denominations – including Orthodox, Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist, Full Gospel, Adventist, and other Christian churches, as well as religious communities of Bukhara and European Jews, Baha’is, Krishnas, Buddhists, and others — over 2,200 resulting religious organizations.

					In Uzbekistan people of all nationalities and confessions often celebrate the different holy days together, including Ramadan, Easter, Pesach, Purim, Hanukkah, and others. They also make pilgrimages to the holy places of their faith in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Greece, and Israel.

					Social hostilities or disagreements involving religion are almost non-existent in Uzbekistan.

				<p>Navruz is one of the most treasured holidays in Uzbekistan. Sometimes known as Persian New Year, Navruz is a chance to celebrate nature, to welcome a new year, and to enjoy flavorful food with friends, neighbors, and family. The most famous of Navruz dish is sumalak, made from germinated grains and stirred for a whole day by the women of the neighborhood.

				Navruz originated in Khorasan, in northeastern Iran, about 3000 years ago. Navruz is celebrated on the spring equinox, which is usually March 21. Also known as Nowruz, the holiday is celebrated across Western Asia and Central Asia, all the way to the Black Sea and the Balkans.

				Though many people celebrate Navruz as a secular holiday, it is a religious holiday for Zoroastrians. The holiday celebrates the day in the spring when day and night are equal, and is the start of a new year. Traditionally, people forgive their enemies, make amends, help the poor, and cleanse their houses and consciences for a good start to a new year.

				Sumalak (also known as samanu) is one of the main attractions on Navruz. Sumalak is made from germinated wheat, and takes a whole night to cook. Women from the mahalla (neighborhood) gather around the pot to sing and stir, so that the sumalak doesn’t burn. In the morning, the warm sumalak is handed out to neighbors, relatives and friends. With the first taste of sumalak, you should make a wish.
