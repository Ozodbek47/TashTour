      <h1 class="text-success">A Brief Explanation of the Venturer-Traditional Scale</h1>
      <p class="text-info">Based on the research, we classify people along a continuum from Venturers to Traditionals; we then break that continuum into six categories (the Travel Personalities). Your Travel Personality matches the kinds of travel experiences and destinations that you enjoy the most. The majority of people are near the middle of the scale; read on to learn about yourself and, if you've convinced your travel partner to take the quiz, read about him or her too!
      <br>
      <br>
      Venturers and Traditionals place at opposite sides on this personality trait scale and prefer very different kinds of vacations and activities while on a vacation. Centrics fall in the middle and generally can swing one way or the other to some degree to please their travel partners. If you and your partner place at opposite ends of this scale, you will have to choose destinations more carefully. Fortunately, some places offer so much to see and do that they satisfy all travel personality types. You'll learn about those places too when you look at how various destinations place on the venturer-dependable scale.

  <h2>Your Travel Personality Type</h2>
  <p>Now you may learn more about your Travel Personality and which destinations provide the most satisfying vacation experiences for you.
    <br>You should find that most of the description fits you quite well. But, since we are all still unique in many ways, some characteristics may be true of a majority of persons with your personality but not all.

      <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse1">
        <div class="panel-heading" style="background: #ff5c33;">
        <h4>TRADITIONALS</h4>
      </div></a>
      <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body" align=left>Your actions are more predictable and dependable than is true of many people. Others know they can rely on you to do what you say because you follow through on your commitments. And, more than any other group, what others see on the surface reflects your true personality. You don’t play games in dealing with friends and associates. A handshake is your word and you mean it. That’s why I call you a Traditional – you act the same with all people. Nothing fake about your personality. You also have the distinction of belonging to the smallest group, comprising just 3% of the population.
          <br><br>
With a love of some consistency and predictability in your life, does it mean you lead a boring existence? Hardly! A sense of routine can make changes to your daily routine seem much more interesting and exciting. Besides, your calm and steady personality provides an extraordinarily important function in society. Through your commitment to consistency and honesty, you add stability to daily life of others around you, helping to keep society from being pulled off course by those who constantly want to change what is tried and true. Without your stability, there would be fewer lasting common values that serve as glue to society and give the nation a sense of direction and purpose.
<br><br>
At work, in your church (if you attend), or in your lodge group, you are often the one that people ask to do a task when they want it done right. Your relatively quiet and easygoing manner, coupled with your commitment to doing everything well, means that others know they don’t have to continually check on you. You have qualities that many other people wish they had, but admit they don’t have the patience to practice. Your travel habits tend to follow a more easy to understand pattern. You would rather go to places that have earned a well deserved reputation as being great, rather than experiment with more recently discovered and, potentially, less satisfying destinations.
<br><br>
These better known places offer much of what you want, including interesting things to do and predictable quality for hotels and restaurants. These well established destinations usually have major hotel chains at all price levels, a good selection of restaurants (particularly family style), and entertainment facilities that you may not have time to use very often back home, such as miniature golf courses, arcades, movie theaters, and established entertainers.
<br><br>
When given a choice, you usually prefer to travel with a group of people, rather than alone. Your preference is to take trips with friends because you enjoy the company of others. Interesting people that you meet on a trip can also add to the overall quality of your experiences. Fully escorted tours are chosen more often for your trips, especially when you go to Europe or someplace far away. You see the many advantages of these tours. These ensure that you hit all of the important spots, good hotels are selected so there’s no risk in your choices and, since restaurants are largely predetermined, you need not give much thought to the possibility of getting sick on local food. You enjoy sightseeing activities considerably, and it is especially helpful to have a guide who serves as an interpreter and can handle money exchange and other problem situations you might encounter in a strange country.
<br><br>
You travel less than all other groups, take fewer vacations, don’t go as far from home, stay away fewer nights, and spend less on those trips. Also, you often have a great preference for destinations you can drive to, rather than having to get there by airline. When you find a place you like, you would much rather return to it on a regular basis than seek out a new and different spot each time. In this manner, you have reduced some of the risks associated with selecting a new spot for each vacation, a typical pattern of Venturers.
<br><br>
When you do take a trip, there is a lot to talk about when you return-so much that you have seen, so much that you have done. You hope to retain the excitement of all this to some degree by picking up some of the visual reminders of where you have been. These might be silver sugar spoon sets from England to add to your collection at home, a matched set of Hawaiian shirts, or a desk-size copy of the Statue of Liberty or the Eiffel Tower. Crowds at places you visit don’t bother you. Rather, you like them. Lots of people having fun, like you, means that it’s a great place or they wouldn’t come.
<br><br>
Your media habits contribute heavily to the rankings and importance of most of the top shows on television. Because you are a social person, you enjoy the type of humor that permeates many sitcoms. Baseball is often the favorite sport for your type of personality with your interest growing in intensity during pennant races and world-series playoffs. Because you like the more captivating feel of television, you tend to read fewer magazines and books than other groups.
<br><br>
An important goal in life is to reduce risk and make sensible choices. Therefore, you tend to be a late adopter of new products. You prefer to wait until competing technologies have sorted themselves out, the winning products or brand names have established themselves, and prices have declined to the point that they now seem stable and offer very good value. In this manner, you are much better at saving money than venturesome types who will try out new unproven products when they first come out, and when they’re at their most expensive point in product life cycles. Thus, you seek out discount stores and follow advertised sales events. In your daily shopping, you tend to select more popular, well-known brands. Their popularity means that they must be good or so many others would not be using them.
<br><br>
In summary, if you fit the typical personality type of an Traditional, you are a very valued person because you help to keep society on course. Your travel habits are more predictable than is true for a Venturer. In general, you want to choose destinations that are well known, provide good value for the money, and offer an array of the kinds of entertainment and things to do that you also enjoy back home. You don’t travel as much and, when you do, you’d rather jump into the family auto or camper/trailer, rather than get on an airplane and face the uncertainties that go with today’s air travel.
<br><br>
Your preference for escorted tours when you take a trip grows out of the fact that they ensure that you’ll see all of the important and interesting places at a price that is highly competitive, and because you also enjoy being around people. Obviously, look for places that measure high in providing satisfaction for Traditional personalities to ensure that you will enjoy your next leisure trip to the fullest.</div>

      <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse2">
      <div class="panel-heading" style="background: #ffa500;">
        <h4>SIGHTSEERS</h4>
      </div></a>
      <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body" align=left>You are called a Sightseer because you fit between the Traditionals and Journeyers. Your steady and unwavering personality means that others can depend on you to help them out when they’ve run into difficulty or need help on a personal project. But you are a little more flexible in approaching your daily routine than a pure-Authentic who prefers a more routine daily existence. Like most people you’ve faced your share of troubles in life but you have been far better than many in being able to handle them with a sense of calm and steadiness.
          <br><br>
An easygoing approach to life wins a lot of friends, so your social circle can be very broad and interesting. You especially develop deep and long lasting friendships. Most of us like to be around people who allow us to be as we are, and your acceptance of almost anyone and everyone creates that comfortable feeling for others. Typically, your demands from life aren’t heavy. You don’t buy fancy cars, or change them every two years, live in a grand house, or brag about your accomplishments. However, golf provides lots of fun for a foursome of friends to rib each other and make it a truly social event. You consider life to be rather good just taking it as it comes on a daily basis. If you have faced a lot of difficult situations in life, these have probably made you a stronger person and also better adjusted. You recognize more of what is good, cherish it, and come away with greater contentment.
<br><br>
Your personality type can go one of two ways depending upon which path you choose. Most who are like you possess great home-related skills-wood-working, home fix-up, cooking and sewing, gardening, and related activities-to the point that neighbors and friends admire your accomplishments and ask for your help with their own feeble attempts to replicate what you do so easily. But, if you haven’t kept active, you also understand that there can be a downside in your daily life. An easy going approach can lead to too much TV, munching on snacks as you watch, or just sitting around and talking with others too often. The inactivity, you recognize, is beginning to show in your waistline and it makes you less energetic than you wish. However, if you’re one of the wise ones, you have that under control and have decided that you’ll get more active so that you don’t become a pretty dull person.
<br><br>
Like Traditionals, you prefer watching TV to reading newspapers and magazines, and will rent recent movies for your home entertainment center as soon as these are available from a local video rental store or online. Baseball is a popular sport with you, and you also tend to be an avid follower of favorite football and basketball teams. It’s great to get together with friends at your house or theirs to cheer on the home teams or go to a game for a tailgating party.
<br><br>
Your mellow personality also impacts your approach to travel. Most likely, leisure travel doesn’t measure at the top of your list of priorities. You’d rather spend time around the house doing fix-up jobs, enjoying your back yard, or having barbeques and visits with friends and neighbors. When you do take a trip, you typically prefer popular places with lots of sunshine like Florida, Arizona or California. You want the assurance of good weather and the certainty that you know what you’ll experience after you arrive. And you like to return regularly to places you have visited before that you have really liked. You don’t want surprises-going to a new destination and finding that it was not what you or your family expected. And you’d rather take the trip in your car/SUV or camper/trailer. This allows you to take along many of the things you like to have with you on a vacation trip, as compared to going by air and being limited to a couple of bags per person. Many in your group own good-sized mobile homes, and they love to go to places where they can meet others with similar interests and swap stories at night and enjoy the social gatherings. Some people even plan dates in advance when they will meet with other camper/mobile home owners again and renew their friendships.
<br><br>
If you travel internationally, the best choice for you and others with similar traits is to select a good tour company. Handling all of the details of planning a big trip is not something you enjoy, and they take care of everything, including emergency situations while on the trip. You will meet a lot of people who have similar interests, helping to make the trip even more enjoyable. You might also want to consider a cruise in the Caribbean. Great weather, beautiful beaches, and a chance to meet a lot of people on board that you will probably enjoy. Cruise friendships can last for years, and some even plan upcoming cruises to be with people they met on previous voyages.
<br><br>
To make your next trip one that you will most likely enjoy, look for destinations from our list that rank high for those with Traditional personalities. These choices were made by people with similar personalities who have gone to the places that you would also probably like and they have ranked them high on their list.
<br><br>
Because you have broad travel interests (you’ll travel by car or by air), you will find destinations that will please you among places preferred by Sightseers and also Voyagers. It’s a rather fortunate position for you since more destinations can please your type of person.

    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse3">
      <div class="panel-heading" style="background: #3cb371;">
        <h4>JOURNEYERS</h4>
      </div></a>
      <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body" align=left>Typically you are one of the most valued employees wherever you work. Your steady nature means that you show up for work on time, every day, and require few sick days off. You know your job well and others turn to you to solve problems. And you have an easy way with people. You like them and they like you. This combination of knowledge, skill, dependability, and good people skills usually results in promotion to more senior supervisory or management positions. You know how to manage people—put the right kind of pressure on them to do their jobs, support them when they need help, but still let them know of your disappointment when they don’t live up to your expectations. These traits also carry over to other parts of your life. If you have children in school, you are more likely than average to be involved in the PTA and, in fact, one of the leaders. Or you might play an active role in your church, or help out with Little League or Pop Warner football. Your deep sense of moral commitment leads you to take on these kinds of responsibilities. It’s likely that you have some certificates or awards in your desk drawer at home that recognize your contributions from some of the organizations with which you have worked.
<br><br>
You believe that you have a lot of common sense and, the fact is, you usually do. You might have an interest in the latest technology, but you won’t consider these new-fangled gadgets until they have proven themselves in the marketplace and have dropped in price to the point where they now seems relatively affordable. And if something you have used for years seems to work well, you feel it’s a dumb decision to run out and buy a hi-tech replacement that takes a lot of time to learn and doesn’t provide many recognizable benefits. Thus, unless someone gave you a digital camera or a hand-held PDA (personal digital assistant), you might still be using an older point-and-shoot film camera and a hand-written address book. Life moves at a rapid pace so you don’t particularly like to complicate it by buying unneeded accessories. Like others with authentic personality characteristics, you probably possess a lot of home-related skills. As a woman, few can match your cooking and sewing abilities. As a man, you can handle most problems on your car or truck, or repair just about anything that goes wrong around the house.
<br><br>
When you shop, you usually stick to popular brands. Their popularity demonstrates that these are good products or they would not have gained such prominence in the marketplace. And these often go on sale, which fits with your common sense notion of never paying more for a product than is necessary. You love sales and faithfully bring double discount coupons to the supermarket to save hard-earned dollars.
<br><br>
Your media interests typically focus on some of the most popular TV shows—sitcoms, and reality-based series. And you probably are an avid sports fan—following the fortunes of a favorite professional or college football and basketball team, especially if it’s local or a place from which you graduated. Because there are so many of you and you like the entertainment provided by television, your viewing habits contribute heavily to the success or failure of many shows. You may not take a daily newspaper or subscribe to magazines, preferring to get your U.S. and world information from television and sometimes the Internet.
<br><br>
The characteristics just described also determine your travel interests. As mentioned, you will fly on some trips, but usually this is only when you are going to a family reunion or taking the kids to Disney World or some place similar when time is short and where you want to go is not close by. Generally you’d rather drive because you enjoy getting behind the wheel and don’t mind spending extra hours on the road because it provides a sense of relaxation, rather than the hurried schedules that seem to accompany air trips. If you have a camper or trailer, you’ll use it a lot. You may like fishing or just being outdoors in a beautiful setting, which are both possible when you drive yourself. Taking the kids to places where they can get out and run without someone showing their displeasure at their exuberance is another reason to have a camper because other people you meet have similar interests. If you choose a more typical destination for a trip, it doesn’t bother you if there seems to be a lot of people around. They are just like you—having fun with a spouse or the family and just enjoying the moment. Beach areas and other places that have good weather hold great interest to you. And you especially want them to have acceptable motels if you didn’t come in your camper. Family restaurants, movie houses and video arcades for the kids add to the attractiveness of a destination for you. You’d like good shopping to be available also so that you can bring back some reminders of where you’ve been—hats or shirts with the name of the destination or resort that you visited.
<br><br>
If you decide to take a long distance trip to some place that you have heard about but it seems relatively foreign to you, a good choice would probably be to book an escorted tour. You won’t get lost, all the details are handled for you and whoever goes with you to remove much of the frustration, and you’ll see much more than if you tried to do it on your own. And tours are relatively inexpensive considering all of the services provided because the tour operators negotiate volume hotel and meal discounts that are not available to the public. Or consider a cruise to a warm locale like the Caribbean. Almost all major cruise lines get very high ratings in the studies I (S. C. Plog) have conducted over the years. They maintain clean ships, the service is good from the staff, and the meals are something to behold.
<br><br>
Because you have broad travel interests (you’ll travel by car or by air), you will find destinations that will please you among places preferred by Pioneer and also Voyagers. It’s a rather fortunate position for you since more destinations can please your type of person.

        <h4>VOYAGERS</h4>
      </div></a>
      <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body" align=left>Your significance lies not just in how many people are like you, however. It also grows out of the fact that you are easier to motivate to take a trip or buy a product than the personalities that lie more on the extremes on either side of you. Venturers tend to ignore advertising. Traditionals (at the opposite end of the scale) pay attention to advertising but their commitment to a regimen and daily routine makes it more difficult to change their habits and motivate them to take a trip. In contrast, you are more flexible and adaptable, with a willingness to sample new destinations if a travel promoter presents enticing advertising.
<br><br>
It would be easy to assume that you are simply an “average” personality and do not go to extremes on most things. This assumption, however, would cover over your much more unique personality characteristics and behaviors. More than other groups, you use mixed transportation modes for leisure travel. In the same year, you are likely to fly to one or two destinations and drive to a couple of others. In contrast, your counterparts prefer either to fly (Venturers) or drive (Traditionals). Although air travel saves tremendous amounts of time when the distances are great, the convenience of auto travel (take everything that you want with you and leave when you want to), along with the ability to move at your own pace provides its own inherent interest.
<br><br>
Unlike Venturers, you prefer at least a modest selection of good hotels and some quality commercial development before you visit an area. A good bed in a nice hotel, food that can be trusted, and a transportation network that can help you get around are what you consider to be basic necessities that you would like to see firmly in place before you visit. But, when over-commercialization sets in, signified by many souvenir shops, the intrusion of fast food outlets, and the diesel smell from too many tourist buses, you will move on to some other place that has not yet lost its qualities of freshness and uniqueness. The kinds of things that you like to buy on trips to foreign lands are the products that various countries specialize in as part of their national heritage. Thus, wool sweaters and skirts in Scotland or England; crystal in England, Germany or Scandinavia; pottery and silver in Mexico; or semiprecious stones from various countries around the world serve not only as reminders of a great vacation, but they can be used when you return home.
<br><br>
The great capitals of Europe have long been favorites, but some of these now seem overcrowded, far too expensive, and unfriendly in how local citizens treat tourists. Therefore, when you go to Europe you might visit smaller towns and enjoy leisurely drives through the countryside. And, when you go into villages, you particularly enjoy staying at quaint little bed and breakfasts (B&Bs) in contrast to well known hotels.
<br><br>
The diversity of the kinds of places that would be of interest to you opens up many more travel destinations of potential interest than is true for either Venturers or Traditionals. You could enjoy a cruise in the Greek Isles, a car trip through gold mining ghost towns in California, or a shopping spree in New York City equally well. You will probably return to a place that you particularly like every two to four years, interspersing other new destinations (for you) in between. In some respects, you can have the most satisfying travel experiences because of your ability to absorb, and like, such different types of places. If you follow the typical pattern for your personality, you travel both independently (probably with a spouse or a friend) and occasionally take a fully escorted tour. This might include international tours and domestic to see New England’s fall colors, visit Southern mansions, or follow historic routes as part of a tour group. Depending upon your age, the Elderhostel program is largely made up of your type.
<br><br>
Cruising has experienced strong growth in recent years, thanks to the fact that you believe that the experience is not as confining as in the past. You have decided that it is affordable and more interesting than you ever thought. And, very important, it’s so easy and comfortable because your hotel room goes with you wherever you are and you don’t have to pack and unpack every day. You may also own a time share, the concept of owning one or two weeks of vacation time in a condo in a resort area. Time shares tend to offer excuses for travel and most of these owners venture forth regularly.
<br><br>
You have mixed media habits, combining both TV and reading. You enjoy quite a few shows on TV, read an occasional book, and some of the popular magazines.
<br><br>
In summary, you are part of a group that is very important to the travel industry, including destinations, airlines, hotels and restaurants. And, because you are generally easier to motivate for travel through advertising and are willing to visit a variety of destinations, most travel companies desperately try to focus on you and your needs. They offer lots of special deals and incentives to get you to travel. You use mixed modes of transportation to get there, tend to return to a place only if you especially like it but no sooner than three to four years, and you also mix up the kinds of lodging that you use. On the same trip you might stay at a three or four star hotel, an economy/budget motel, and a B&B.

        <h4>PIONEERS</h4>
      </div></a>
      <div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body" align=left>Your venturesome spirit leads you to seek out unique and interesting places to visit and especially to make each leisure trip different from others that you have taken. You may want to return to a place that seemed interesting but you didn’t have time to explore on an earlier visit, but usually you simply want to try something new. However, there’s a big difference between you and your true Venturer friends: you like a comfortable bed at night (no sleeping under the stars), a warm shower, and meals that you can trust rather than taking a chance on native foods. You listen carefully to the unique travel tales of your friends and associates, or read heavily, to learn about the hidden, but interesting out of the way places that others have not yet become popular or have only recently gotten some publicity. The press has given your group a name — the jet-set. Your interest in what’s new and what’s happening leads you to be one of the first to visit destinations that seem to have a new ambience, or book a few days at a new spa or resort you read about in a travel magazine, or tour a country that until recently was closed to visitors. Travel providers absolutely love you because you are central in making new destinations popular. Airlines, hotels and restaurants should give you special treatment since they benefit from the travel choices you make. You’ll tell your friends about a great trip you just had and they will want to do the same when they get some time off.
<br><br>
Like pure Venturers, you like adventure travel — but of a different type. Physical exertion is fine, if it isn’t extreme. If you took a bicycle tour of New England in the fall, you want to stop at interesting places for lunch and bed down at night in a quaint inn, rather than sleep out under the stars. And you prefer to have a van follow behind to pick you up and ride to the next overnight stop in case you or your partner feel a bit exhausted.
<br><br>
History holds a great fascination for many Pioneers. But if you’ve seen Buckingham Palace and the Eiffel Tower, or traced Paul Revere’s route in New England, you don’t need to repeat the experience. Rather, you’d prefer to stop in lesser known old cities and enjoy the ambience created by old buildings that exude their own sense of importance and romance, especially if they’re not listed in guide books. To discover an ancient monastery, old fort or historic building quite by chance and wander through quiet interiors unhampered by crowds, offers an opportunity to imagine what mysteries it holds and tales of romance or tragedy.
<br><br>
Even your media habits don’t follow the norm. Typically you read more than most — books, magazines and newspapers — and watch TV less. When you turn on the “tube,” you are much less likely to prefer any of the top ten sitcoms or “soaps.” Instead, you’ll seek out dramas, special news magazine format shows, and selected sports (as football and basketball; you have less interest in baseball or hockey). Consistent with your travel interests, you particularly like fact based television shows or dramas in a historic setting, and programs that explain the workings of some of our modern marvels. You hold definitive opinions about much of what you see happening in the world, especially politics, and strongly prefer commentators who agree with your views.
<br><br>
Exercise and good health habits — proper diet, some use of vitamins and supplements, and following a disciplined routine to get enough sleep and exercise, even when you travel — are more likely to be part of your daily commitment than is true for most people you know. You may prefer participating in individual sports, such as skiing or singles tennis, rather than those that are more social such as golf or bowling. You are likely to own exercise equipment at home, a treadmill or a stair climber.
<br><br>
You like technology and probably have a heavy loading of it as part of your daily life. Typically you will not be the first to try out new hi-tech products-that distinction belongs to the pure Venturers. You’re likely get on the bandwagon when they new product or service has shown that it has some relevance to your daily business or home life. But you are still willing to buy these items long before they have become so popular that they have dropped dramatically in price. More than is true for most groups included in this personality scale, you are likely to be an opinion leader. Since you show a willingness to accept innovation and change, but with a common sense attitude about it (use what is good and discard what doesn’t help in some way), others look to you for guidance and direction on what to buy, choices to make in their lives, and the kinds of trips that they might like to take. This combination of character traits-mild risk taking, common sense in the decisions you make, and a friendly and outgoing personality-usually contributes to success in your career. More than most, you are likely to hold a senior position of responsibility in your company and will continue to advance in the future.
<br><br>
In looking for destinations that will satisfy your intellectual curiosity, seek out those that measure higher for Venturers. You share so many traits in common with that group that most of these places will help ensure that your next trip will hold the enjoyment and contribute to the kinds of memories that you want. But make certain these places have adequate hotels and restaurants.

      <div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body" align=left>You’d rather fly than drive on your vacations because driving takes too much of the time you could spend at the destination pursuing the things you like to do. And you typically want to explore areas almost without a plan — and without a tour guide to discover the unexpected sights, sounds and culinary delights that every new travel experience can bring. You definitely do not like to travel with a group or follow a rigid, pre-determined itinerary. If you ever joined an escorted tour, it probably was by accident. You will not willingly make that choice again. You want freedom, glorious freedom, to follow your interests of the moment. You are happiest when you feel unfettered and unrestricted by the dictates and commands of others.
<br><br>
Typically, you like to visit relatively unknown and uncommon destinations long before travel writers have discovered them and encouraged hordes of people to come. You will even put up with inadequate hotels and food if you can be there before commercial development — and the crowds of tourists — consume the place. You might have to bed down in a sleeping bag if an inn can’t be found. Above all, you want a sense of spontaneity in your trips, a feeling that something new and fresh will happen every day, and perhaps several times a day. That adds a sense of joie d’ vivre and a hearty carefree feeling of enjoying life at its fullest to your travel experiences.
<br><br>
Unique cultures especially attract you. The opportunity to meet people of different backgrounds, languages, and social standards holds a special allure. Even when you don’t speak the language, a frequent occurrence for someone with your venturesome spirit, you’ll get around just fine. Sign language, a handful of words you’ve picked up, a lot of pointing (to pictures of where you want to go or of food you want to order), and even some laughing moments will help you get comfortably through just about every situation you encounter.
<br><br>
Adventure travel also holds a special fascination, particularly what is called hard adventure experiences. These might include navigating your own canoe down the Amazon, bicycling with a friend through the wine country of France, or trekking to villages in Nepal accompanied by a guide rather than as part of a tour group. Some of these trips can only be taken by those who are in good physical shape and could involve some element of physical danger. And, no trinkets or souvenirs for you. Rather, you buy authentic arts and crafts, clothes or other reminders of your grand escapes. Everything must be real, with no sense of falseness.
<br><br>
What you do on a trip, in many ways, is a reflection of your daily lifestyle. Again, the higher your score on the scale, the more you are likely to pursue activities described below. You love to experiment with life. New products, especially technology, typically hold a special fascination. You may have been the first among friends to own a large screen HDTV, a hybrid car, or experiment with the latest personal digital assistant (PDA) or cell phone that has just been introduced. You’re willing to buy new products long before these become popular and more reasonably priced. The joy of discovery far outweighs the risks associated with purchases that don’t live up to their promise or that will soon become more reasonably priced after intense competition takes over in the marketplace. Searching, seeking, probing, looking for something new and different, always wanting something new in your life — these are characteristics that friends and relatives would probably say are part of your personality, if an outsider asked about you.
<br><br>
This constant interest in what is new can also cause you some problems. You may experience difficulty in balancing your varied personal interests and hobbies to the point that at times you feel like your life lacks a central focus that can help provide a sense of direction and stability. Your boundless sense of energy, intellectual curiosity and continual interest in new ideas can make it difficult to find someone who also views the life in so many varied ways. And others may not be able to match your energy level.
<br><br>
Perhaps most important, you are relatively comfortable and at ease with the decisions you make. This low level of anxiety about how you manage your life’s affairs not only adds to an aura of self confidence that is evident to your circle of friends, but also helps to make you relatively successful in your occupation and various other pursuits in your life. Confidence breeds success because others will accept what you say and follow your lead. But, if you haven’t found the right job, you may feel somewhat like a misfit. Others don’t quite seem to catch on to what you’re thinking. That feeling, of having ideas others don’t understand, often leads venturers to go out on their own to start up new businesses. Venturers traits are found in many successful entrepreneurs!
<br><br>
Most likely you convey a friendly personality to others but, in fact, many times you’d like to skip the next cocktail party or social gathering that some work associates or neighbors have planned. Small talk can bore you. And, somewhat surprising with your energy level, you can be reflective and contemplative at times. You can enjoy being alone, especially doing things by yourself with no schedule or commitments. That’s also a formula for a truly great vacation. Just wander around and take whatever time seems warranted to explore the interesting sights of the day, or to pursue personal sports and other activities.
<br><br>
In conclusion, your travel personality indicates you like to explore more than average and are willing to take the risk of choosing a destination unknown to your friends and that might turn out to be a less than satisfying vacation experience. You are likely to read a lot of books and magazines to learn about where else you might want to go that is truly different from the last place you visited. All in all, that’s a definition of a venturesome personality. Look for destinations on the website that score high for Venturers and you’re more likely to end up with a great vacation.
